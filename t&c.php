<p>Opening day booking ($)(120th day in advance, excluding the date of journey) will be available only after 8 AM. If you try booking before 8 AM, for opening day's tickets, the reservation will fail, with your account getting debited; IRCTC will refund the entire fare and IRCTC's service charges , but the bank/card transaction charges are likely to be forfeited.</p>
<p>($)(Opening day means 120 days in advance of the date of journey (journey date not to be included) from train originating station . Please note that in case of some intercity day trains, the ARP (advance reservation period) is less than 60 days. ) For Tatkal booking, opening day means one day in advance from date of departure of train from originating station. For e.g.-if train is to depart from originating station on 2nd August, Tatkal Booking for AC class will Commence at 10:00 AM and for Non AC class will Commence at 11:00 AM on 1st August(in case of E-Tickets Only).</p>
 <p>Issue of Tickets User Registration: You must be a registered user to use our site to book tickets and for any type of enquiries. No user can register more than once on the site.

 <p>Scope of Service: IRCTC makes no guarantee that any service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure or error-free. </p>

Example: Suppose a train is running from New Delhi to Chennai with halting stations at Agra and Vijaywada, a passenger can book either for New Delhi-Agra, New Delhi-Vijayawada, New Delhi-Chennai, Agra-Vijaywada, Agra-Chennai or Vijayawada-Chennai subject to distance restrictions imposed by the Indian Railways. The facilities not available for tickets booked on Internet vis-à-vis tickets booked at PRS counters are available in Para B above. </p>

 <p>Allotment of coach/berth/seats will be done as per existing allocation logic available in the PRS. We do not guarantee allotment of seat/berth of your choice.

In case a lady passenger alone or with children under 12 years, is willing to reserve berth/berths in ladies quota wherever earmarked, she can give choice 'Ladies' in the field of quota. If berths are available in ladies quota the system will allot accommodation in ladies cabin otherwise accommodation will be allotted in General quota, as available.

If any one of the Payment Gateway is not functioning please try the other one available.
